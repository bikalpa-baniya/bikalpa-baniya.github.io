The following notes are based on Mankiw, *Principles of Macroeconomics*, 10th Edition

## Thinking Like an Economist
- Economics is about trade-offs
- Opportunity Cost
  - Definition: It is defined as the value of the next best alternative. It is the value you forgo when you make a choice.

## Interdependence & Gains from Trade
### Production Possibility Forntier (PPF)

- The following is the PPF for a country that only produces oil and cars.

</p>

- Production efficiency means that there is no way to produce more of one good without producing less of other goods
- A: Amount of oil produced if the country only produces oil
- B: Amount of cards produced if the country only produces cars

### Oppoutunity cost and PPF

- What is the opporunity cost of going from point C to D? 

<p align="center">
  <img src="Ch2_PPF_OC.png" alt="Ch2_PPF" width="400">
</p>

Step 1: Equate production if the country only produced either of the good

$$ 50 \text{ mil barrels of oil} = 30 \text{ hundred thousand cars}$$

Step 2: Since we are increasing the production of cars make the right hand side one
$$ \frac{50}{30} \text{ mil barrels of oil} = 1 \text{ hundred thousand cars}$$

Step 3: Car production increases by $15-9=6$ so make the right hand side 6 by multiplying both sides by 6

$$ \frac{50}{30}*6 \text{ mil barrels of oil} = 6 \text{ hundred thousand cars} $$
$$ \Leftrightarrow 10 \text{ mil barrels of oil} = 6 \text{ hundred thousand cars} $$




So, moving from C to B requies giving up 10 mil barrels of oil. 

Additional notes: 
- Economic growth results in the PPF shifting outwards
- Shape of PPF
    - If the PPF is a straight line the opporunity cost is constant
    - If the PPF is bowing outwards the opporunity cost in increasing
    - If the PPF is bowing inwards the opporunity cost in decreasing
### Positive statement vs Normative statement

- Positive statement - Statement that are testable
    - Example: The unempolyent rate is 4%
- Normative statement - Statement that are based on opinions
    - Example: The unemployment rate should be 0%

## Application to International Trade

### Comparative Advantage vs Absolute Advantage

- Absolute advantage
    - A country (individual) has an absolute advantage if it can produce more good or service than others
    - Absolute advantage has nothing to do with gains from trade 
- Comparative advantage
    - A country (individual) has an comparative advantage if it can produce a particular good or service with lower opportunity cost
    - In other words, they have to give up less
    - Gains from trade are based on comparative advantage

### Calcuating Comparative Advantage

Conside two countries that produce either iphones or video games. The following table shows 

### Gains from Trade 
- Main idea: **Trade allows countries to consume at a level in the PPF that is otherwise infeasible **
- See Chapter 3 Question 3
