The following notes are based on Mankiw, *Principles of Macroeconomics*, 10th Edition

## Ten Principles of Macroeconomics
---
## Thinking Like an Economist
- Economics is about trade-offs
- Opportunity Cost
  - Definition: It is defined as the value of the next best alternative. It is the value you forgo when you make a choice.

## Interdependence & Gains from Trade
### Production Possibility Forntier (PPF)

- The following is the PPF for a country that only produces oil and cars.

</p>

- Production efficiency means that there is no way to produce more of one good without producing less of other goods
- A: Amount of oil produced if the country only produces oil
- B: Amount of cards produced if the country only produces cars

### Oppoutunity cost and PPF

- What is the opporunity cost of going from point C to D? 

<p align="center">
  <img src="Ch2_PPF_OC.png" alt="Ch2_PPF" width="400">
</p>

Step 1: Equate production if the country only produced either of the good

$$ 50 \text{ mil barrels of oil} = 30 \text{ hundred thousand cars}$$

Step 2: Since we are increasing the production of cars make the right hand side one
$$ \frac{50}{30} \text{ mil barrels of oil} = 1 \text{ hundred thousand cars}$$

Step 3: Car production increases by $15-9=6$ so make the right hand side 6 by multiplying both sides by 6

$$ \frac{50}{30}*6 \text{ mil barrels of oil} = 6 \text{ hundred thousand cars} $$
$$ 10 \text{ mil barrels of oil} = 6 \text{ hundred thousand cars} $$

So, moving from C to B requies giving up 10 mil barrels of oil. 

Additional notes: 
- Economic growth results in the PPF shifting outwards
- Shape of PPF
    - If the PPF is a straight line the opporunity cost is constant
    - If the PPF is bowing outwards the opporunity cost in increasing
    - If the PPF is bowing inwards the opporunity cost in decreasing
### Positive statement vs Normative statement

- Positive statement - Statement that are testable
    - Example: The unempolyent rate is 4%
- Normative statement - Statement that are based on opinions
    - Example: The unemployment rate should be 0%

## Application to International Trade

### Comparative Advantage vs Absolute Advantage

- Absolute advantage
    - A country (individual) has an absolute advantage if it can produce a good or service more than others
    - Absolute advantage has nothing to do with gains from trade 
- Comparative advantage
    - A country (individual) has an comparative advantage if it can produce a particular good or service with lower opportunity cost
    - In other words, they have to give up less
    - Gains from trade are based on comparative advantage
- Example from Microeconomics 
    - Consider the two centers from the 2024 Denver Nuggets: Nikola Jokic and DeAndre Jordan.
    - Assume that Nikola Jokic is better than DeAndre Jordan at all facets of basketball. In other words, **Jokic has an absolute advantage**.
    - However, unlike Jokic, Jordan specializes in rebounding. So, it does not cost Jordan as much if he just rebounds the entire game (his opportunity cost for is lower). So, even if Jokic might be a better rebounder, **Jordan has an comparative advantage in rebounding**.
